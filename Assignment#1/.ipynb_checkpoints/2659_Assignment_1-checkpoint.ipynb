    "### Question 2 (5 points) Geohashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Geohashing is an outdoor sport activity played around the world since 2008. Contestents need to adventure to a geocoordinate generated by an algorithm that derives randomness from stock market data (as you should all know Eugene Fama's EMH). \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is explained as below from [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/426/):\n",
    "![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/geohashing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It described a way for a computer to create an algorithm that could generate random Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates each day based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the current date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your task is to decode the geohashed secret location by using Nova SBE's geocoordinate, current date (September 18, 2020) as well as the opening of DJIA on that day. Luckily, Python already has a library to calculate the geohasing using the `geohash` function in `antigravity` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from antigravity import geohash\n",
    "geohash(37.421542, -122.085589, b'2005-05-26-10458.68')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first and second parameter takes the lat/lon of your preferred location and the third parameter takes the date as well as the opening of DJIA on that day, connected by `-`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now calculate the geohashed location using Nova SBE's geocoordinates (38.678223, -9.326266), and the current date Setember 22, 2020 and the opening of the DJIA with two decimals (you can find this at any finance news and thank you Jerome Powell!!!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you decode the location, go to google map, find out the address and write it down in the answer."

    "\n",
    "The number $e$, known as [Euler's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) (named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler), is a mathematical constant.  It is the base of the natural logarithm. It is the limit of $(1 + \\frac{1}{n})^n$ as $n$ approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest, as your all know from your economics/finance 101 course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in 18th century, Euler derived this number through the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$e = \\frac{1}{0!}+\\frac{1}{1!}+\\frac{1}{2!}+\\frac{1}{3!}+\\frac{1}{4!}\\dots+\\frac{1}{n!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's stand on the giant's shoulder to get our own $e$. To do so, you need to write a function ```factorial``` to calculate the factorial number given the $n$ and then use ```for loop``` to generate the $e$. Let $n$ go from 0 to 10, and save the derived value of $e$ in a list and print it out when n is an odd number (up to 10).\n",
